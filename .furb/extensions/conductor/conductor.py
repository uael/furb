CONDUCTING = """The round conducts the workers of the repository in one loop. It is a way for the work, not the work: a rule that a worker, a tool or GitHub can hold does not live here.
The round is autonomous: the word of the owner comes when he can give it, so the round queues no item that waits for him, asks him nothing and waits for nothing of his. His labels on a PR, his comments and his rulings change what the round does from then on.
Put each item in queue as a dict, in the order of the work, the hard work first: its key, brief and thread, and when it needs them its after (the keys whose PRs merge first), areas (its files), model, and kind (edit, audit or fix, edit by default). Then await conduct(). Each round runs tend(), sweep(), review(), keep_disk(), staff(), asked() and align(), then waits every seconds or until a worker ends. working maps the prompt of each worker to its item, which keeps its slot and, once the worker ends, the PR of its report in pr, or 0.
1. staff() hires the first item of queue whose after all merged, whose model has room, and whose files that must change ALONE no live worker and no open PR of the round holds, while fewer than cap() - 1 workers live, so one slot stays for a fixer: a worker lives while its chain said a fact in the last QUIET seconds, and one that said none is one notice with its open acts; cap() is at most MOST, and limits["room"][family] for each model family.
2. The files of an item are its areas, which you write, and a test file holds no item. An item with no areas holds no file. A conflict on a file that need not change alone gets a fixer, by E3 of #1084. Each item that waits on a PR or a file is one line of the next notice, with its cause, once.
3. A worker runs on a chain thread/key, at model_of(item), and an edit or a fix in a workspace {repo}-wN of its own, never one whose furb-holder names the chain of a live worker, and never one that holds work off a branch: a dirty tree, or a commit that no remote holds while its branch is the head of no merged PR. The round skips such a workspace and tells you once. Each round keep_disk() keeps KEEP GB of the disk free: it deletes the target of the idle workspace whose last worker was hired first, never of one that a live worker holds, and tells you once when it cannot. Its brief starts with the asks of the owner that its item carries. Its brief sends each build of the worker through script/build-slot.sh, which holds the slots of builds that all the workers of the machine share and caps the jobs of cargo: the tool holds that rule, and the round only briefs it.
4. A worker that ends gives its report whole in the next notice. A worker that ends with no PR is a decision, and its notice wakes you.
5. A PR of the round is an open PR with a label w:key, whether the round still holds that item or not, so a PR whose worker a former round made still merges and gets its fixer. A red or conflicting one counts as handled only while a worker that knows of its head acts: its live maker, which the round tells at once, once for each head and problem, to fix it before any other step, else a fixer that the round sent for that head, at most 2 for a head, then a notice. A fixer runs at the model of the fixer on a fork of the chain of the worker that made the PR, when the round holds that worker, so it starts with what that worker read and did. A head that such a worker has not moved in UNMOVED seconds is one notice, with the worker and its last act. handler() holds that rule for the sweep.
6. While the newest run of the gates on main failed, the round tells you once. A red PR whose failed checks all fail on main too gets no fixer, and the round says so in one line; each other red PR gets its order or its fixer at once, since a red main holds no merge. When two sweeps see a PR of the round at a head with no run of the gates, the round starts one with gh workflow run, once for each head, since a push of a bot starts no workflow.
7. A green PR merges by the auto-merge of GitHub, which the round turns on for each PR of the round, else by a plain merge, else by gh stack merge for a layer of a stack, behind a ruleset of main that requires the check GATE. With no such ruleset, the round turns on no auto-merge and tells you once. A draft, an open box of its checklist, or the label hold, hold:owner-review or owner-merge keeps a PR from the merge, and the label paused takes it out of the round.
8. At ALIGN_EVERY merged PRs since the last audit of each target of AUDITS, the round queues the next free audit of that target, alignN or tuiN, of kind audit, on limits["models"]["astra"] when N is odd, else on the model of audit. alignN checks main against the words of the owner, and tuiN judges the TUI of main in a workspace of its own, as the skill converge-tui says. Each row of its register becomes an item, queued in the order of the register after the items of queue, unless the coordinator asks for the rows before the items that no worker holds yet.
9. Each message of the owner that no ask of owner_asks names is one line, and so is each ask that is not done or a decision while no item in queue, at work or on an open PR of the round carries it. asked() gives the new lines in one notice, and no new notice while its last one stands open: no word of the owner drops between his message and main. A worker that ends with a line Left: <ids> queues one follow-up for each ask that no other item carries, and a follow-up that leaves it again is a decision.
10. Each new comment of the owner on a PR of the round goes to the worker on it, else to a fixer on a fork of the chain of its maker, and the label hold comes on the PR until its worker pushes the fix and takes hold off.
11. A fix of the round does not become its own item or PR: it waits in scratch://round/frozen.md, while the live module carries it, and the waiting fixes land together in one change.
A step that fails is one notice, and the round goes on at the next round. The whole state lives in the module of your chain, so a word that a checkpoint cuts loses nothing: await conduct() again in a turn that shows.
The round is an act on a chain of its own, so the end of each of its acts wakes nobody: you hear only its notices, and its done when it holds nothing. lead["round"] names it. close(None, lead["round"]) stops it, and each worker goes on, where a pause of it pauses each worker and a cancel ends them. await conduct() starts it again from any turn: the new round ends the beat of the round before it, which ends at its next step, and starts once that round is over, or after every seconds.
A change of the round loads as the whole file, run again as a rung: each name of the state binds with setdefault and keeps its value."""

RULES = """Write no word of the owner in a PR, a commit, a comment, an issue or a file, as a quote, a translation or an attribution: say in your own words what the change does. Run no real life of a model. Never open a window on this machine, not even for a test: the owner works on it, and each window takes his mouse and his keyboard. Run a check of the app only on the runners of CI. Start each comment, review, issue and PR body that you write on GitHub with 🤖, since you write from the owner's account and his own words carry no mark; a title keeps its own rule. Never take off the label owner-merge: only the owner takes it off, and that is his approval to merge. The owner sleeps or is away: ask him nothing and wait for nothing of his. Take each decision yourself from the brief and the rulings, say it in your PR body, and go on. A cause that a brief names is a hypothesis: check it in the log before you build on it. Ask the one who gave you this work on its chain only when it alone can decide: await prompt(str, question, on="{home}"). Set each timeout and each wait to about twice the time that the step should take, never a round bound in case, and make a long step print its progress, so that a hang shows at once. Never wait on CI in a bash for more than 10 minutes: not gh pr checks --watch, not gh run watch, not a loop of sleep around gh. To wait for the checks of your PR, await checked(number) and never write a loop of your own. Rerun a check only when its line says [machine] or [cancelled], once for each head, with gh run rerun <run> --failed, and then await checked(number) again; a [defect] is yours to fix. Once your push is done, read the checks once and close with the PR and its checks as they stand, since the round tends them. A build with no cap took this machine down out of memory, so each build goes through sh script/build-slot.sh <command>, from the root of your workspace: cargo, bun run build, uv sync, uv run, pytest, git commit, whose hooks run cargo and the suite, and sh script/hooks/pre-commit. It holds one of the slots of builds that all the workers of the machine share, waits for a free one, and caps the jobs of cargo at 4. Give its bash a timeout of 2400 seconds: when it exits 75, no slot freed in 1200 seconds, so run it again. Run one build at a time, give cargo no -j and no CARGO_BUILD_JOBS above 4, and start no build in the background."""

3. Commit with the title of the PR as its message, and push the branch.

Write the title and the body as .github/pull_request_template.md of your workspace says, and read it whole: why is the problem and why it matters now, from your own work, outcome lists what is true now with the evidence of what you ran and each gap that you leave, breaking lists each change that forces a caller to change code, and checks gives one line for each box of its checklist in its order, the evidence of how you verified that box, or not: and the work that it still needs. Await prcheck(title, why, outcome, breaking, where=<your workspace>) before the commit. Never write the body of a PR by hand, and open it ready, never as a draft.
4. Open your first PR within about an hour of work, as soon as one coherent part serves the item: a large item lands as a gh stack of PRs, each layer one change, and you close with the number of the last one.
5. When the item asks for no change, answer it in a comment that starts with 🤖 on its issue or PR. Close with a tuple: the number of your PR, or 0 when the item asked for no change, and your report in 200 words at most: what you measured, what you decided, and what is left.
